#### Q: Describe a person you know who likes to talk a lot.
- You should say:
	- Who this person is
	- How you knew this person
	- What he/she usually talks about
	- And explain how you feel about him/her

In my social circle, there's a person who undoubtedly strands for their proclivity for taking-my friend Sara - who is both a friend and a workmate at the moment. I first got to know her during our college days, and our paths crossed due to shared classes and mutual friends. Sara is an effervescent individual who always has something to say, be it anecdotes, opinions, or the latest happening in her life. However, she does remain fairly quiet, controlled and composed at work.
Sara's conversations are<b><u> diverse</u></b>,<b><u> ranging from lively discussions about current event to personal stories </u></b>that keep everyone engaged. She<b><u> has an uncanny ability</u></b> to turn event the most mundane topics into lively dialogues. While her verbosity can be overwhelming when she's had a little too much wine to drink, it does <b><u>add a unique dynamic</u></b> to our group interactions over dinners.
Feelings toward Sara's talkative nature are a mix of amusement and appreciation. On one hand, <b><u>her energy and enthusiasm contribute to the vibrancy of our social gatherings</u></b>. On the other, there are moments when one might wish that she'd just keep quiet, you know, just like she is in the office. Nevertheless, her<b><u> loquacious character</u></b> has become an integral part of our social circle, <b><u>making her a memorable and cherished friend</u></b>.

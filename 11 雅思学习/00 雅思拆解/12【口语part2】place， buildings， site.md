#### A:
- The place where I go where I can really relax is the local park. I am lucky enough to live really close to a nice park - in fact, it's a great park - and it's free to get in! It's got a huge lake and a number of wonderful gardens with trees, plants, flowers, and <b><u>areas for old and young people to do recreational activities.</u></b> There is also a cafe and a restaurant in the park, as well as boats on the lake, tennis courts, and a children's play area. I go there almost every weekend, and although it is really popular park, there are always quiet areas where you can sit alone on a stone bench or at a little table. During the summer months I go there regularly to read and study and just walk around and <b><u>clear my head</u></b>. I feel great when I'm there and I enjoy the fact that there is peace and quite there, as well as activities that people can do. It's a  fantastic environment to be in - and<b><u> the park is really well-tended and look after</u></b>. It's an ideal place for individuals like me who want to go alone and get some fresh air and enjoy a natural space, as well as families who want to take their kids out to enjoy the activities available there.
#### Q: Describe a place where people made a lot of noise.
You should say:
- Where you heard the noise
- Who made the noise
- How you reacted to the noise
- And explain how felt about the noise

<b><u>One memorable instance of encountering a cacophony of noise took place </u></b>during a music festival I attended <b><u>in the heart of the city</u></b>. <b><u>The vibrant event</u></b>, attracting music enthusiasts from diverse backgrounds,<b><u> emanated lively beats and melodies.</u></b> Performers <b><u>from various genres, ranging from rock bands to electronic DJs</u></b>, contributed to the auditory kaleidoscope.

The noise, generated collectively by the crowd's cheers, music reverberations, and excited chatter, <b><u>created an electrifying atmosphere. </u></b>Revelers, donned in colorful attire, danced energetically, adding to the dynamic soundscape. Instead of being overwhelmed, <b><u>I embraced the vivacity of the moment</u></b>,<b><u> immersing myself in the shared joy of the crowd</u></b>.

Reacting with enthusiasm rather than annoyance, I found joy in the harmonious chaos of the festival. The noise, far from disruptive, became a testament to the <b><u>collective celebration of music and shared experiences.</u></b> The<b><u> pulsating energy and diversity of sounds</u></b> left me with a positive and exhilarating impression, reinforcing the belief that noise, when part of a shared celebration, can be a source of joy and connection.

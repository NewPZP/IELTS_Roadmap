#### A: 
Several  years ago, I embarked on an unusual journey to the beautiful region of Patagonia in Argentina. I went with a group of close friends, and we chose this destination <b><u>because of its breathtaking landscapes and unique wildlife</u></b>.<b><u> Instead of opting for the usual tourist activities</u></b>, we decided to<b><u> trek through</u></b> the <b><u>stunning</u></b> Andes Mountains.
The holiday was<b><u> filled with awe-inspiring  moments </u></b>as we navigated through challenging <b><u>terrains</u></b>, encountering  <b><u>diverse flora and fauna</u></b>, What made it truly unusual was our decision to camp in remote areas,<b><u> disconnected from modern amenities</u></b>. We embraced the simplicity of nature, cooking over open fires and sleeping beneath the vast Patagonian sky.
This unconventional holiday stands out because it <b><u>pushed us out of our comfort zones</u></b> and allowed us to<b><u> connect with nature in a profound way</u></b>. The absence of typical tourist attractions made it an extraordinary and memorable experience. 


#### Q: Describe a time when people near you made a lot of noise.
You should say:
Where you heard the noise
Who made the noise
How you reacted to the noise
And explain how you felt about the noise

#### A:
A few month ago, I found myself in a bustling city square during a lively festival. The noise <b><u>emanated</u></b> from a diverse crowd <b><u>engaged in various activities </u></b>like street performances, live music, and<b><u> vendors promoting their goods</u></b>. Initially, the <b><u>cacophony</u></b> felt overwhelming, but as I embraced the festive spirit, I joined in the celebrations, interacting with the crowd and <b><u>appreciating the vibrant energy around me</u></b>. Despite the initial surprise, I came to enjoy the lively atmosphere, realizing that t<b><u>he collective noise was a testament to community's shared joy and celebration</u></b>.

So, at first, the intensity of the noise was <b><u>startling</u></b>. Navigating through the crowed streets,<b><u> I felt a twinge of annoyance</u></b>, actually, as the sounds merged into a chaotic symphony. However,<b><u> as I immersed myself in the festivities</u></b>, as I said before, my initial irritation<b><u> gave way to</u></b> a growing sense of excitement and community spirit. The shared joy and celebration <b><u>permeating</u></b> the air became infectious.

So, basically, I went from <b><u>being in the kind of frame of  mind</u></b> when I wasn't in the mood for noise at all, to actually <b><u>getting carried away with the spirit of the occasion</u></b>. It just goes to show that sometimes we need to<b><u> shift our mood</u></b> when it comes to moving from one type of activity to another, or one state of mind to another, and I think that's very true when it comes to living in a big city where you are likely to be going from quite places  to noisy places, from stressful places to fun places - you have to learn to be adaptable - and <b><u>that's one of things that stood out that I took away with me that day</u></b>: it's good to be a little bit adaptable.

#### Q: Describe a job you don't want to do in the future.
You should say:
- What it is
- Where you knew if from
- Why you think it is difficulty or easy
- And explain why you don't want to do it

There are lots of jobs that I wouldn't want to do! But I think the worst of those would be a bus diver in a big city. I hate traffic. I really hate traffic in cities here - there are too many people, too much cars and too many bad drivers to be honest. I really do not like being in traffic here, so I cannot imagine how stressful it would be to actually be driving a bus all day long as a job. It would be my idea of a living nightmare!

I know about the job because everyone is aware of this, it's common profession, it's not a strange or bizarre job. I think it's difficult job because it involves a massive test of one's patience. Also, it's tiring driving  a bus all day. I actually drive a car and I find that really tiring after just an hour in this traffic, so I cannot imagine how tiring it would be to driving all day every day -  especially something big like a bus - you have to pay very close attention to the road and be constantly aware of really bad drivers all around and ahead of you. I'd hate it, I really would hate it with a passion. I feel very sorry for city bus drivers, and I sincerely admire their patience!

The seat should be level front to back. the seat height should be adjusted to allow a slight bend at the knee when the leg is fully extended. the handlebar height should be at the same level with the seat

Also wear something that reflects lights, such as reflective tape or markings, or flashing lights. remember, just because you can see a driver doesn't mean the driver can see you.

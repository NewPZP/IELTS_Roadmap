## What type of  headphones do you use?
- I'm a big fan of wireless headphones. When I use ones with wires, they always <b><u>get tangled up and sometimes they fall out</u></b>. So I have earbuds that I can use Bluetooth. It's so convenient. I also find that<b><u> the sound quality is superb</u></b>. The sound is crisp, and the built-in microphone doesn't pick up my breathing when making phone calls.
